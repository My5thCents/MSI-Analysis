# MSI-Analysis

This is an analysis of the different champions that have been picked so far at MSI. I analyzed the various picks and set
a guideline of requiring 5 picks to be analyzed further. I then plotted the various champions who have been picked
or banned more than 5 times and compared their actual win rates to what we expect the win rates should have been.
